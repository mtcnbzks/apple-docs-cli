- When checking platform availability or minimum OS versions
- When looking for WWDC session content, transcripts, or code examples
- When exploring framework symbols (classes, structs, protocols, enums)
- When finding sample code from Apple
- When discovering related or alternative APIs

## Setup

```bash
npx apple-docs search "SwiftUI"
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm i -g apple-docs
```

## Instructions

Based on the user's question: $ARGUMENTS

## Flags

- `--type <type>` — Symbol type filter (class, struct, enum, protocol)
- `--limit <n>` — Max results
- `--year <year>` — Year filter
- `--framework <fw>` — Framework filter
- `--topic <topic>` — Topic filter
- `--platform <p>` — Platform filter (ios, macos, watchos, tvos, visionos)
- `--language <lang>` — Language filter (swift, occ)
- `--depth <d>` — Search depth (shallow, medium, deep)

## Tips

- Start with `search` for general questions
- Use `doc <url>` to get full details on a specific API found in search results
- Use `symbols <framework> --type <type>` to find specific classes/structs/protocols
- Use `platform <url>` to check OS version requirements
- Use `wwdc-search` to find implementation guidance from WWDC talks
- Chain commands when needed: search → doc → related
